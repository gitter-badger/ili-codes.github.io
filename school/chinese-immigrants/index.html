<h1>Notes</h1>

<li>The Canadian Pacific Railway went from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean</li>
<li>There wasn't a lot of farmland in China so Chinese immigrants loved the idea of going to a new country and getting farmland.</li>
<li>Other reasons to immigrate were war, floods, growing population, droughts, and high taxes. </li>
<li>Lots of men came and immigrated to Canada because of lots of job opportunities.</li>
<li>Building the railroad was very hard business. It was very cold.</li>
<li>European railway workers thought that Chinese workers took away their jobs.</li>
<li>Chinese workers got paid less than European workers.</li>
<li>To earn extra money, Chinese workers had to do dangerous jobs like blowing up things. Many died and their families were never told.</li>
<li>Soon, Chinese workers were not needed in Canada but they could not get back home to China.</li>
<li>A tax was made for <strong>only Chinese immigrants</strong> that was raised from $50 to $500 in about 20 years.</li>
