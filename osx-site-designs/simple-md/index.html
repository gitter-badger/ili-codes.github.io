		<h1 id="mac-os-x-el-capitan">Mac OS X El Capitan</h1>
<h3 id="revolutionary-">Revolutionary.</h3>
<p>Macintosh is famously known for its easy-to-use interface and it 
pioneered the graphical interface in 1984 with System 0.1. With System 
0.1, people didn’t have to type in commands anymore. They could use a 
“mouse” to click on things. It was revolutionary. So revolutionary, in 
fact, that Microsoft decided to copy Macintosh’s interface with Windows 
1.01, released in 1985. That’s how the Graphical Interface was made. 32 
years later, Macintosh is still the leader in graphical interface 
design, thanks to Jony Ive and his design team. The Mac’s interface is 
revolutionary easy, especially with Mac OS X El Capitan, the latest Mac 
OS (at the time of writing). Split-screen apps, the Dock, Launchpad, 
Notification Center, Finder, and more give Mac OS that easy look. </p>
<h3 id="powerful-">Powerful.</h3>
<p>Deep down, it’s more powerful than it looks. Powered by a UNIX core, 
the same stuff that makes up servers, it’s blazing fast and very 
powerful. It can be used to check mail or edit the code to the app that 
will cure cancer. Either way, Mac OS is very easy-to-use and very 
powerful. Maintenance is taken care of already, so no need for registry 
edits or disk defragments. All you need to worry about is getting your 
work done. </p>
<h3 id="and-more-">And more.</h3>
<p>Mac OS also allows for easy searching. Just press Option-Space and 
you’ll get Spotlight, a text box that can calculate, search, open, 
define, and more. OS X also comes with Handoff and Continuity, features 
that allow you to use apps on your Mac (example Google Chrome) with your
 iPhone, syncing progress, URLs, saves, and more. If you open Safari on 
Mac and shop on Amazon, and you open Safari on iOS, it'll sync all your 
tabs, carts, and progress straight to your iOS device.</p>
